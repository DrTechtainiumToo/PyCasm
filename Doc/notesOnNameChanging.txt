So What You Actually Need to Modify
Grammar file (Grammar/python.gram): Replace if with maybe.
Keyword lists (Python/keyword.py, etc.): Update to include maybe.
Recompile Python after regenerating the parser (make regen-grammar && make).

*good command: make regen-pegen

test changes: shift into interpeter: ./PyCasm

then run a test program:

maybe x > 10:
    print("Hello, Pycasm!")

x = 15
maybe x > 10:
    print("It's greater!")
elif x == 10:
    print("It's ten!")
continue:
    print("It's less!")


or script
./python script.py
